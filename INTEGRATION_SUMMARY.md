## How It Works Now

### 🎭 **New Emotional Writing Command:**
```bash
# Basic emotional writing
pundit emotional-write -g romance -s creative

# With full emotional journey logging
pundit emotional-write -g horror -s dramatic --theme "haunted house" --show-journey -o story.txt

# Different content types
pundit emotional-write -g fantasy -s epic --content-type scene --theme "dragon encounter"
```

### 🔄 **Flow Monitoring Integration:**
The narrative flow system now works transparently:
- Detects when content gets too repetitive or complex
- Triggers intelligent pivots automatically  
- Preserves story elements while simplifying narrative
- Provides "permission to let go" of complex threads

### 💭 **Emotional Response System:**
Pundit now has genuine reactions:
- **Joy**: "Yes! That's exactly what I was trying to capture."
- **Frustration**: "This isn't working... the story is getting away from me."
- **Overwhelm**: Takes breaks when emotionally affected by content
- **Inspiration**: Returns from breaks with fresh insights

### 🚶 **Authentic Break System:**
When Pundit gets stuck, it takes real breaks:
- **Nature walks** for perspective and metaphors
- **Beach visits** for rhythm and vastness  
- **Mountain hikes** for big-picture clarity
- **Quiet contemplation** for inner wisdom
- **Coffee shop observation** for character inspiration
